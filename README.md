# DeliveryBoy
Unity remake of Delivery Boy Task

Hints about editing this repo:
The "MainMenu" scene is responsible for calling DeliveryExperiment.ConfigureExperiment, and then loading the MainGame scene.  In the MainGame scene, just look at DeliveryExperiment.Start which launches the coroutine that controls the entire flow of the experiment.

NOTE:
Town Constructor 3/Textures was liscensed from PurpleJump and is too big for github.  Please visit our private UPenn box to access it if you are a member of the team. (system_3_installers/delivery person)
