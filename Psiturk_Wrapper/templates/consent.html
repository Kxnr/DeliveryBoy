                        You have been invited to take part in a research study being 
                        by the Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                        In this study, you will navigate around a virtual town experiencing events both visually and auditorily. 
                        You later be asked to make responses based on these events, such as recalling them. 
                        Full instructions will be provided before the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experiment will last approximately 60-70 minutes, not
                        counting breaks. The only minor risk of the study is fatigue
                        from completing the task. There will be opportunities to
                        rest between trials, in case you need to take a break at any
                        point. You will be given up to four hours to
                        complete the study before the HIT expires. You must
                        participate throughout all trials of the experiment (i.e.
                        navigating and making recalls when prompted) for
                        us to mark the HIT as complete. We will mark HITs as
                        complete within two business days.

                        Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may stop
                        the experiment at any time. If you have any questions about
                        your rights as a research participant, or about this study
                    in general, please contact the principal investigator:
