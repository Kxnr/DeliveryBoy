#. Clone the 'Courier Repo <https://github.com/pennmem/Courier>'_
#. Download 'Unity version 2021.3.2f1 <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive>'_. The two methods to do this are:
    #. Unity Hub (recommended)
    #. Unity Installer
#. Download the 'Textures folder <https://upenn.box.com/s/1s1ba0u6tf2hktigw0z7onxciduswpl1>'_ from *system_3_installers/delivery person/Town Constructor 3* in the UPenn Box
#. Put the newly downloaded Textures folder in the *Courier/Assets/Town Constructor 3* folder of the Courier Repo
#. Open the project in Unity
#. Go to *Assets > Scenes* in the project pane on the bottom of unity and double click the *MainGame* file to open the map
#. Download the 'Configs folder<https://upenn.box.com/s/r06s5e0f6zjd4sjyhb4l4ivjrucecwwb>'_.
#. Make a folder named "data" on your Desktop
#. Rename the configs folder to "configs" and put it in the new "data" folder

Unity Hub Setup
=============
#. Download Unity Hub (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html)
#. Create Account
#. Click Activate New License Button (top left)
#. Select "Unity Plus or Pro" and put in Serial Number (ask James or Ryan for the serial number)
#. Click the "back arrow" in the top left to the top menu

..
#. Then follow the rest of the guide mentioned above (specifically the "Installing the Unity Editor" section)

Note: It does not show download or install percentage (just a bar), so you just have to wait patiently (edited)
